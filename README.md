# Your life in weeks

Inspired by [this post of Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) and [this video by Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXeJANDKwDc)

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). 

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv).

## Deployment

Merge changes into branch `pages-build`, run `npm run pages` and push.
